# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler functions as a means to keep track of events throughout one's day. It also has a built in clock, allowing for one to compare their upcoming events to the current time. During the creation of the javascript that went into opperating the functionality of the site, I learned much about jquery, localstorage, and dayjs. I also was able to learn more about bootstrap by seeing it in play.

## Usage

This website stores user data input in the numerous time slots, allowing for one to refresh or close the page and still see the same events they wrote previously. It also has a built in clock with the date, as well as color-coated sections that display the the past, current, and future time slots based on the current hour.

Below is a gif displaying the website's functionality, as well as a link to the website.
